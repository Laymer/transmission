README for the Transmission git-svn clone

This is a collection of patches that didn't make it into the official
Transmission source, but were still deemed useful by some would-be
contributors. You can choose to pick some of the changes, and merge them
into the 'master' branch, or you can use the 'all' branch, which features
all patches.

Before you can start using the clone, you need to run the 'init.sh' script in
this repository. It will take care of setting up git-svn remotes for you.

Below is the README of Transmission itself.
